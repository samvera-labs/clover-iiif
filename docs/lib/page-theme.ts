/**
 * Site-level theme overrides: accent colour and font family.
 *
 * These are not preview controls. They exist to demonstrate the thing that makes Clover
 * themeable — components read CSS custom properties from whatever contains them — so the
 * values are set on the document root rather than on a wrapper around the preview, and
 * they outlive the playground when a reader navigates into the docs.
 *
 * That means the state cannot live in React alone. It is applied to `documentElement`,
 * persisted, and restored on a cold load of any page by `pages/_app.tsx`.
 *
 * What each override touches:
 *
 *  - **Accent** sets `--accent-9`, the single literal in the docs accent scale. Every
 *    other step is mixed from it in `tokens.css`, and `--clover-color-accent` maps to it,
 *    so this one property retints both the docs chrome and any rendered component. It
 *    also sets `--nextra-primary-hue` / `--nextra-primary-saturation`, which Nextra
 *    composes its own primary colours from in `hsl()` — it takes hue and saturation as
 *    variables and bakes lightness into each utility, so handing it H and S shifts the
 *    whole family while leaving Nextra's light/dark contrast choices intact.
 *  - **Font** sets `--font-sans`, the site's own family, so the whole website changes —
 *    prose, chrome and headings, which follow it through `--font-display`. Clover is not
 *    named anywhere in this: its components inherit their type from whatever contains them,
 *    so retypesetting the page retypesets them for free. That is the demonstration.
