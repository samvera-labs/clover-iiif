/**
 * Font families offered by the playground's page-theme control.
 *
 * A mix of Google families and system stacks, so a reader can see Clover pick up a real
 * webfont as well as something already on their machine.
 *
 * Loading six extra families sounds expensive and is not: `next/font/google` self-hosts
 * them and emits an `@font-face` per family, but a browser only downloads a font file
 * once a rule actually applies that family. Until someone picks one from the dropdown,
 * the cost is a few hundred bytes of CSS and zero font requests. Nothing is fetched from
 * Google at runtime either, so the static export stays self-contained.
 *
 * Weights are pinned to 400 and 700 to match the two-weight system the docs use
 * (`--weight-regular` / `--weight-bold` in `tokens.css`); the variable families cover
 * that range from one file, so `weight` is only declared for the static ones.
 *
 * These loaders have to be reachable from `pages/_app.tsx` — which they are, via
 * `docs/lib/page-theme.ts`. Reached only from `_document`, Next emits class names but no
 * stylesheet and downloads nothing.
 */

/*
 * Options are written out per loader rather than shared from one object. `next/font`
 * options have to be statically analyzable — the compiler reads them at build time to
 * fetch the files — so a spread would not survive, and each family also types `weight`
 * and `subsets` as its own literal union.
