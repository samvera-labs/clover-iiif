# Overview

UI component library for rapidly creating high-quality and accessible IIIF-fluent web interfaces.

Clover IIIF is a suite of Manifest and Collection components combined with lower-level IIIF Presentation 3.0 API UI components. Clover IIIF has a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use Clover IIIF to build your own custom IIIF-fluent web interfaces while still using the full power of the IIIF Presentation 3.0 API.

## Vision

Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API does not need to be limited to a primary viewer. Using Clover IIIF breaks the model of a "viewer" and allows the IIIF Presentation API to be used as a front-end for any web application. This is possible because the IIIF Presentation API is a highly defined and interoperable specification for representing digital objects. This means that the IIIF Presentation API can be used to represent any digital object, not just images. This concept gives creation to highly interoperable web user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Accessibility** - All components lean on [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) to ensure that they are accessible to all users.

- **Customization** - All components are designed to be easily customized with CSS.

- **Developer Experience** - All components are built with developer experience in mind and are designed to be easily integrated into any web application.

## Compatibility

- React 18 and 19 are supported.
- Recommended Node version: 20.5.0.
